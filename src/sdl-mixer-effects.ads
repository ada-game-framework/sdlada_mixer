   --  This is the format of a special effect callback:
   --
   --  Channel is the channel number that your effect is affecting. Stream is
   --  the buffer of data to work upon. Len is the size of Stream, and
   --  Udata is a user-defined bit of data, which you pass as the last arg of
   --  SDL.Mixer.Effects.Register, and is passed back unmolested to your
   --  callback. Your effect changes the contents of Stream based on whatever
   --  parameters are significant, or just leaves it be, if you prefer. You can
   --  do whatever you like to the buffer, though, and it will continue in its
   --  changed state down the mixing pipeline, through any other effect
   --  functions, then finally to be mixed with the rest of the channels and
   --  music for the final output stream.
   --
   --  Do never call SDL.Audio.Lock from your callback function!

   --  Register a special effect function. At mixing time, the channel data is
   --  copied into a buffer and passed through each registered effect function.
   --  After it passes through all the functions, it is mixed into the final
   --  output stream. The copy to buffer is performed once, then each effect
   --  function performs on the output of the previous effect. Understand that
   --  this extra copy to a buffer is not performed if there are no effects
   --  registered for a given chunk, which saves CPU cycles, and any given
   --  effect will be extra cycles, too, so it is crucial that your code run
   --  fast. Also note that the data that your function is given is in the
   --  format of the sound device, and not the format you gave to
   --  SDL.Mixer.Open, although they may in reality be the same. This is an
   --  unfortunate but necessary speed concern. Use SDL.Mixer.Query_Spec to
   --  determine if you can handle the data before you register your effect,
   --  and take appropriate actions.
   --  You may also specify a callback (Effect_Done_Access) that is called when
   --  the channel finishes playing. This gives you a more fine-grained control
   --  than SDL.Mixer.Channels.Finished, in case you need to free effect-
   --  specific resources, etc. If you don't need this, you can specify Null.
   --  You may set the callbacks before or after calling
   --  SDL.Mixer.Channels.Play. Things like SDL.Mixer.Set_Panning are just
   --  internal special effect functions, so if you are using that, you've
   --  already incurred the overhead of a copy to a separate buffer, and that
   --  these effects will be in the queue with any functions you've registered.
   --  The list of registered effects for a channel is reset when a chunk
   --  finishes playing, so you need to explicitly set them with each call to
   --  SDL.Mixer.Channels.Play.
   --  You may also register a special effect function that is to be run after
   --  final mixing occurs. The rules for these callbacks are identical to
   --  those in SDL.Mixer.Effects.Register, but they are run after all the
   --  channels and the music have been mixed into a single stream, whereas
   --  channel-specific effects run on a given channel before any other mixing
   --  occurs. These global effect callbacks are call "posteffects".
   --  Posteffects only have their Effect_Done_Access function called when they
   --  are unregistered (since the main output stream is never "done" in the
   --  same sense as a channel). You must unregister them manually when you've
   --  had enough. Your callback will be told that the channel being mixed is
   --  (Mix_Channel_Post) if the processing is considered a posteffect.
   --
   --  After all these effects have finished processing, the callback
   --  registered through Set_Post_Mix runs, and then the stream goes to the
   --  audio device.
   --
   --  Do never call SDL.Audio.Lock from your callback function!
   --  Raises Mixer_Error if error (no such channel).

   --  A distance of 255 does not guarantee silence; in such a case, you might

   --  mixing process with SDL.Mixer.Channels.Halt.
   --  For efficiency, the precision of this effect may be limited (distances 1
   --  through 7 might all produce the same effect, 8 through 15 are equal, etc).

   --  260). Angle 0 is due north, and rotates clockwise as the value
   --  increases. For efficiency, the precision of this effect may be limited
   --  Angles 1 through 7 might all produce the same effect, 8 through 15 are
   --  equal, etc).
   --  Distance is an integer between 0 and 255 that specifies the space
   --  between the sound and the listener. The larger the number, the further
   --  away the sound is. Using 255 does not guarantee that the channel will be
   --  culled from the mixing process or be completely silent. For efficiency,
   --  the precision of this effect may be limited (Distance 0 through 5 might

   --  and Distance to 0 unregisters this effect, since the data would be
